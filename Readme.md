# Employee Performance Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains code for predicting employee performance using Naive Bayes and later a neural network model. The code involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and building a neural network using Keras.

## Files

* `employee_performance_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for employee performance prediction.
* `README.md`: Documentation file explaining the code and its components.
* `requirements.txt`: File containing the list of dependencies.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:

   <pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 dark:bg-token-surface-primary px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-bash">pip install -r requirements.txt
   </code></div></div></pre>

   Alternatively, you can run:

   <pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 dark:bg-token-surface-primary px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"></span></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-bash">pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
   </code></div></div></pre>
2. Open and run the `employee_performance_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for detailed execution.

## Usage

1. The notebook performs data preprocessing, feature selection, and builds a neural network model for predicting employee performance.
2. Execute the code cells in sequential order to replicate the analysis.

## Additional Information

* The code includes comments for better understanding of each step.
* The neural network model architecture can be modified by adjusting hyperparameters to further improve performance on test set.
